# First Project 2021:

## Goal :
Tackle OTU-testing for Microbial-Endocrinology data,
a.k.a. Gut-Brain Axis (GBA) data comparing “new data”
vs “data at the time the project was written”
for a given data analysis of GBA data.

In addition write out a preliminary approach
and then a final report at the end.

## Details:
Choose a dataset or problem to analyze GBA data or Microbiome data
that can be applied to GBA

- Star with using an existing algorithm or library to create OTU groupings.
- Measure the quality/accuracy of groupings
- might be a solved problem, but the key is to have a documented way of doing this.
- Apply at least one new method to the data
- Measure the difference
- Communicate the difference
- Tooling you made you think “This could be a useful library”
- Split it out...
- Find useful results
- Community impact / communication? Paper authors?
- Find that there are other algorithms, and add those to a table of results
- Discover and communicate what is important with these

## Software Development  
- Build a library that extends the capabilities of the r-Microbiome library to GBA
- The library should have at least one new method to the data.

### Software Testing
- Measure the difference
- Communicate the difference in the final report
- Evaluation as to whether this could be a useful library
  - Communicate with other members of the field
  - Community impact / communication? Paper authors?
- Find useful results
- Find that there are other algorithms, and add those to a table of results
- Discover and communicate what is important about these tools/results

## Duration
- Until the end of May
