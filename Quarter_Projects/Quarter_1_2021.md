# First Quarter 2021:

# Goal : 
Build a library that extends the capabilities of the r microbiome library to the gut brain axis. 
The library should have at least 

# Part 1 (January) : 
Collect all known studies that directly concern the Coeliac-Migraine connection and replicate one or two of said studies.

## Weeks 1 and 2 : 
Collect studies and create a list of all concepts, tools 
and databases used in the studies into a single encyclopedic-like pdf.
Include things like all studies, databases and concepts used,
marked with things like sample-size, p-values, R-squared values, 
or whatever else should apply.

## Weeks 3 and 4 : 
Replicate one or two studies step by step.

# Part 2 (February) : 
Contrast papers collected to new tools used in bioinformatics and systems biology.

## Weeks 5 and 6 : 
Search for new studies in coeliac disease and migraines. 
Scan said studies for informatin that would fit said model.
Also look for new tools used in bioinformatics that may apply. 

## Weeks 7 and 8 : 
Continuing the encyclopedia from `Weeks 1 and 2`,
build a new section in the same paper on the new tools and data used.
Make sure to differentiate the old from the new in the encyclopedia.

# Part 3 (March): 
Apply new tools

## Weeks 9 and 10 : 
Apply everything from part 2 into new research.

## Weeks 11 and 12 : 
This last two-week period should go one of three ways: 
### 1: Continue `Weeks 9 and 10`
That part is arguably the hardest 
and may take much longer than expected.

### 2: Clean up 
Look for weak spots of the previous 5 steps. 
If some area of the encyclopedia needs improvement
or if an area of one of the new tools learned wasn't properly understood,
go back and improve on it. 

### 3: Some combination of `1` and `2`
