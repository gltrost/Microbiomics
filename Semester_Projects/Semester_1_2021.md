# First Semester 2021:

# Goal :
Tackle OTU-testing for Gut-Brain data, comparing “new data” vs “data at the time the project was written”
for a given data analysis of Gut-Brain data.

First write out a preliminary approach and then a final report at the end.

# Details:
Choose a dataset or problem to analyze in Gut-Brain data or Microbiome data
that can be applied to Microbial Endocrynology

Star with using an existing algorithm or library to create OTU groupings.
Measure the quality/accuracy of groupings
- might be a solved problem, but the key is to have a documented way of doing this.
Apply at least one new method to the data
Measure the difference
Communicate the difference
…
Tooling you made you think “This could be a useful library”
Split it out...
Find useful results
Community impact / communication? Paper authors?
Find that there are other algorithms, and add those to a table of results
Discover and communicate what is important with these

#Software  
Build a library that extends the capabilities of the r microbiome library to the gut brain axis.
The library should have at least one new method to the data
