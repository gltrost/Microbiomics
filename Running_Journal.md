# Microbiomics Running Journal

## Mutable Introduction 
This paper serves as a running journal for this my microbiomics project. The idea of this markdown files is to keep a record of my general knowledge, questions, and hypotheses which are bound to change and grow as the project develops. This journal is meant to be updated at least once every few weeks. 

## 11/25/2020: Searching For Ideas
I am trying to find a specific project in microbiomics that can be tackled with bioinformatics and systems-biology. I will continue my search until I find a reasonable question I can tackle, and then start tackling it. Most of my search has been in books and papers on Arxiv. If things look too aimless, I'll consider writing some emails to experts.
