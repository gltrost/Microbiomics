# Microbiomics Running Journal

## Mutable Introduction
No, this is not a journal about my cardio-exercises. This journal is to show my changing and developing thoughts with respect to my microbiomics project. The idea of this markdown file is to keep a record of my general knowledge, questions, and hypotheses which are bound to change and grow as the project develops. This journal is meant to be updated at least once every few weeks.

## 12/6/2020: Venn-Diagram A Success, and on to Next Task
Recreating the Venn diagram from my sources is complete, and it got me familar with .csv-manipulation in R as well as getting familiar with open-source human genome databases. The results I created were not a perfect match with my source since I decided to use different databases. I will continue to recreate the papers' findings one-by-one.

## 12/4/2020: An Idea for an Area, and My Baby-Steps to Manifesting the Idea
One non-trivial aspect of starting a project is understanding how broad of area you want to study. Usually, you find an area you like, and then telescope in until you find a niche enough sub-area that looks manageable. You can then either go more nuanced  if the sub-area is still too broad or zoom out if you've gathered enough results on the sub-area and want to apply your findings or generalize your findings.

My telescoped idea within microbiomics is the relation between Coeliac disease (CD) and cephalgia (migraines). Since I'm still inexperienced in bioinformatics, I will use the articles

1. *Deciphering crucial genes in coeliac disease by bioinformatics analysis* by Noori, et. al, from *Briefings in Bioinformatics*
2. *Bioinformatics methodologies for coeliac disease and its comorbidities* by Del Prete, et. al, from *Autoimmunity*

I'm being lazy with my citation format. My goal will be to reproduce some of the results found in these articles. For example, Del Prete, et. al were able to produce a Venn diagram for CD genes, which they were able to reproduce from various databases [105]. My small goal is to reproduce their findings for this specific Venn diagram. Depending on how that goes, I will either zero in and try to better the Venn diagram results if needed or zoom out if I think I can't realistically do better. I will then rinse and repeat the process for the above articles. I won't be publishing the articles' information for copyright reasons.

## 11/25/2020: Searching For Ideas
I am trying to find a specific project in microbiomics that can be tackled with bioinformatics and systems-biology. I will continue my search until I find a reasonable question I can tackle, and then start tackling it. Most of my search has been in books and papers on Arxiv. If things look too aimless, I'll consider writing some emails to experts.
